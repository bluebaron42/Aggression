## 📋 RECEIVING AGENT WORKFLOW

```
1. Download files from you
2. Place in codespace root
3. Read CONSOLIDATED_LESSON_CREATION_GUIDE.md (main guide)
4. Study LESSON_1_TEMPLATE_SHELL.md (see example)
5. Reference COMPREHENSIVE_MODULE_CREATION_PROMPT.md (while building)
6. Create 8 components following structure
7. Integrate into App.jsx
8. Validate using LESSON_CREATION_STANDARD.md
9. Submit when checklist complete
```

## 🎯 CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE EMBEDDED

Every file emphasizes these requirements:

### ⭐ Answer Randomization (Non-Negotiable)
- Use `useMemo` + `shuffleArray()` pattern
- Randomize on EVERY component mount
- ALL options randomized (scenario AND matching)
- Prevents students from gaming the system

### ⭐ Understanding Check (Slide 4)
- Exactly 5 questions (3 scenario + 2 matching)
- Test ONLY slides 2-3 concepts
- Detailed feedback (2-3 sentences each)
- Always at slide position 4

### ⭐ Do Now Quiz (Slide 1)
- 5 questions from PREVIOUS lessons ONLY
- NO current lesson content
- Spaced retrieval purpose
- No new content on slide 1

These three requirements are reinforced in EVERY document.
